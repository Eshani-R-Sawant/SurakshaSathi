/**
 * Hybrid Decision Engine — combines [TFLiteSpamClassifier] and [RuleBasedClassifier]
 * to produce the final [MessageClassification] + riskScore.
 *
 * Decision logic:
 *   combinedScore = (ML_WEIGHT * mlScore) + (RULE_WEIGHT * ruleScore)
 *
 * Thresholds (tunable via config):
 *   < SAFE_THRESHOLD        → SAFE
 *   < SUSPICIOUS_THRESHOLD  → SUSPICIOUS (escalate to RAG)
 *   >= SUSPICIOUS_THRESHOLD → MALICIOUS (immediate alert + RAG + NCRP offer)
 *
 * Design decisions:
 * - Rules still carry more weight than ML: [TFLiteSpamClassifier] now feeds the model a real
 *   dims-0-33 auxiliary feature vector (see [com.sbi.surakshasathi.feature.messagescan.data.classifier.feature.FeatureExtractor]
 *   and [com.sbi.surakshasathi.feature.messagescan.data.classifier.feature.UrlIntelligenceStage2]),
 *   but dims 34-38 (Stage 3 live-HTTP URL analysis) are still deferred, so the deterministic
 *   rule engine remains the steadier of the two signals for now.
 * - Either classifier alone can push the score above the MALICIOUS threshold
 *   (e.g. APK download URL = 0.40 rule score → SUSPICIOUS even with ML = 0).
 *
 * This is the "is mal?" decision node in the Flow 1 architecture diagram.
