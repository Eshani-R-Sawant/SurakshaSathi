    # Persona history: it was a full-weight one-hot dimension here previously, which meant two
    # otherwise-identical messages could never land in the same micro-cluster if they differed
    # only by persona (a forced Euclidean gap of ~2*persona_weight regardless of how similar the
    # text/region were) -- that fragmented real campaigns into up to 6 near-duplicate clusters
    # (one per persona) and was the reason cluster counts looked implausibly high, so it was
    # removed. It's back now (product decision: alerts should be targeted by persona too, e.g. "a
    # student in Mumbai" vs "a senior citizen in Mumbai" both hit by the same credit-card-spam
    # campaign should form distinct, separately-alertable clusters), but at a deliberately LOW
    # weight relative to region/message_type -- persona_weight_multiplier is well below 1.0 so it
    # nudges/splits clusters only when region+message_type+text are already close, rather than
    # forcing a hard split on persona alone the way the previous full-weight attempt did. Verify
